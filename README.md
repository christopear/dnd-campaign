# dnd-campaign

This project is a WIP. The foundational thought process behind this project is to provide a toolset for simulating societies and people to provide a descriptive back drop to a Dungeons and Dragons campaign.

## Current progress


#### People

The first steps so far have been in creating the people. Name generators have been scraped from [Fantasy Name Generators](http://fantasynamegenerators.com) for each individual class, converted from javascript and put into a working package structure.

## Next steps

* Research has been completed into lifespan modeling in order to accurately capture a person's lifespan.
* I intend to create the basics of a family tree in the next few iterations
